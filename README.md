# Ng6mat

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0-rc.7.

The goal of this project is to test angular material and angular cli of new version. I want to create an easy starter project for angular with material setup to use scss and custom theme. In addition I would need to test new angular cli commands that seem to be changed a lot. My major concern are sourcemaps for scss. Sourcemaps did not worked properly in last version of cli (v1.7.x).

## Branches

- mat-starter: basic starter with material using scss styles. All assets are local and included in styles folder.
