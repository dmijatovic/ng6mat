# Ng6mat

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

The goal is to setup an easy starter project with angular material using scss and custom material theme. In addition, I want to test new angular cli commands.

## Branches

- mat-starter: root component and basic material scss styles. This branch has only root component. All style assets (fonts and themes) are stored in styles folder.
- mat-bs-starter: bootstrap, grid ONLY, added (sass). Only root component, material scss setup and bootstrap grid.
- mat-app-home: including router and basic modules: home, error, help and modal. It also includes bootstrap grid (scss)
- dev: development branch for testing new features
- libtest: development branch te test new library command of angular-cli

## Scripts

Folowing scripts are defined in package.json

- `npm start`: runs default angular cli development setup (not used)
- `npm run dev`: runs app in dev mode using dev environement and dev build definitions (see angular.json)
- `npm run prod`: runs app in dev mode using dev environement and dev build definitions (see angular.json)
- `npm run build`: creates production build using production env and  definitions (see angular.json)

## Code scaffolding
